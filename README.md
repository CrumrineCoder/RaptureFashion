# Rapture Fashion

This is a boutique fashion website that uses Shopify's Storefront API with React to allow users to find dresses, accessories, shoes, or hats and add them to a cart and take them to a checkout to purchase (You can't actually buy them because it's not a real store). This was a practice with designing and marketing a site to have the confidence and know how to work on small business websites. 

## To Do

* Make stuff look pretty and more Art Deco stylized
* Add more items
* Update item descriptions
* Fix right hand margin error on Home
* Make brand pages more engaging
* Fix Lint Errors
* Login and Register, and then wishlists and profiles
* Size Chart (dynamic)
* Responsive
* Art Deco art style (lots of work here)

## Completed Job Stories

Job Story 1: When I'm on the Home page, I can view a carousel that sells me on the business with links to why I should care about Rapture, what brands are featured, and what the collection is

Job Story 2: When browsing, I can filter the collection by color, brand, and sort it by price or name in ascending or descending error. I can also clear these filters. 

Job Story 3: When hovering over a product, I can see the back of it to quickly make a judgement of it without having to navigate to it. I can click on the box to navigate to a detailed page about the product. 

Job Story 4: When on a product description page, I can learn what sizes it comes in, see other pictures of it, see style tips, a short description, what it's made of and misc details, Rapture's delivery, and get links to relevant products. 

Job Story 5: After selecting a size, I can add it to my cart. I can go to my cart to view my items, and change the quanitity or remove items from it. I can view the total cost, and be taken to a checkout handled by Shopify proper. I cannot use the Checkout to buy the items because they do not exist and Nic doesn't want to get sued.
