(( MIght want to work on this in the future: https://css-tricks.com/accessible-simple-responsive-tables/))


Process:
*Figure out design and project goals
*Research UX fashion case studies
*Looked through a lot of websites and found focus for which persona and user needs to focus on as well as figured out business restraints and goals
*Picked out colors and general aesethetic and feel of website
*Broke down feature list and started work on lo-fi wireframes
*After making home and product listing/product details and checkout pages, went through and picked out dresses I would want to display for the test site to figure out the Nav, with only a vague sense of it before hand. 
*Worked on home page until the basics were down 
*Made the dress listing page with a basic filter
*Made the dress description page with an example one
*Pick a size and add to cart with a Redux reducer
*With an example, work on cart bag page
